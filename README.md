This is a project started as the "Capstone" project for IBM's Data Science professional certification.  I added visualizations and incorporated more data sets to get more user-friendly answers.

### The project goal was to characterize the most important areas and type of housing complaints in the NYC area.

This involved the following data sets:
- The [311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) from NYC Open Data
- The [PLUTO land use and buidling characteristics](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page) data set
- Geographic data from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/zip-codes-zipcodes) and for the [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) libraries for choropleth visualizations
